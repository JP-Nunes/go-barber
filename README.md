# GoBarber

This is an app to create appointments with barbers, it's backend was written with Node.Js, it's frontend was built with ReacJS and the mobile version with React Native.

* ## If you want to run it:
  * ### Required technologies:
    * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
    * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    * [Redis](https://redis.io/)
    
  * ### Now, the steps:
    1. In order for the application to work, you'll need to create a table named gostack_gobarber on your postgres, if you want a visual interface to do that, I recommend [Postbird](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/);
    1. Clone the repository into a folder of your preference;
    1. With your prompt, navigate to the source folder of "server" folder, then run "yarn";
    1. Repeat the last step with the folders, "gobarber-web" and "gobarber-mobile";
